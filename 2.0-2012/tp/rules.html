Welcome to Trivial Pursuit!
<p> Here's how it goes:</p>
This is a trivia game. You want to earn a 'piece' from each color. 
<br /> Green = Science and Nature
<br />Blue = Geography
<br />Pink = Entertainment
<br />Orange = Sports and Leisure
<br />Purple = Arts and Literature
<br />Yellow = History
<p> You will spin a spinner to figure out which type of question you will get. Each question belongs to one of these topics. You must answer the question correctly to earn a piece from the corresponding color. Once you have answered one question from all topic correctly you have won! Each color has an equal chance of being spun, so its up to your luck to get the colors you need - but, it's up to your brains to get the questions right. Your score will be based on how many questions it took you to finish. Good Luck!
