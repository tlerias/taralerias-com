<p>As embarrassing as it is to admit, my desire to enter the digital realm of advertising stems from my addiction to Neopets in middle school. I would go on Neopets because they would let users edit the HTML on their homepages. This is my earliest involvement with HTML, CSS and Adobe Photoshop. I used my Neopets homepage as an expression of myself back then, and I still use HTML, CSS and Adobe Photoshop (with the addition of several other programs and languages) to express myself today. Advertising is on the cusp of embracing digital, and I'm eager to graduate college and enter the workforce during this critical time.</p>

<p>I was born and raised in Suburbia, NY (Long Island). I followed the mountains and my love for snowboarding to Boulder, CO. Attending school at University of Colorado these past four years helped me recognize my adoration for camping, hiking and yoga. I usually always have my co-pilot, Lola, by my side â€“ she's living proof that a dog is a woman's best friend. I graduate at the University of Colorado in May 2012. My career endeavors, desire to explore new places, and love for the New York Knicks, will most likely take me back to New York; I plan to move to NYC, and steer clear of Suburbia for a few more years.</p>
